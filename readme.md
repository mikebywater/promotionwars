## About Promotion Wars Online

Promotion Wars was an excellent wrestling booking simulator written by Adam Jennings in 2000. It is a game that will elicit feelings of nostalgia for many wrestling fans. Promotion Wars Online is intended to be a homage to a wonderful game and a chance to have a bit of fun and hopefully learn something new as we go. 

## Contributing
