## About the Project

Promotion Wars was an excellent wrestling booking simulator written by Adam Jennings in 2000. It is a game that will elicit feelings of nostalgia for many wrestling fans. Promotion Wars Online is intended to be a homage to a wonderful game and a chance to have a bit of fun and hopefully learn something new as we go.

You can play the current release of the game at [Promotion Wars Online](http://promotionwars.online).

We are going to try and keep an actively updated roadmap as well as mainatianing a publicly available project and issue tracker on github. Below is the high level roadmap.
